# -Using-Weka-to-predict-whether-a-person-makes-over-50K-a-year
This project aims to utilize Weka, a popular open-source machine learning software, to predict whether a personâ€™s annual income exceeds 50k.
By employing the Decision
tree (J48) and Neural network approaches, we explore the accuracy of these models and
analyze the impact of varying parameters.
